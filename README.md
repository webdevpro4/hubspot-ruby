# HubSpot REST API wrappers for ruby

Wraps the HubSpot REST API for convenient access from ruby applications.

Documentation for the HubSpot REST API can be found here: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/endpoints

## Setup

    gem install hubspot-ruby

Or with bundler,

```ruby
gem "hubspot-ruby"
```

## Authentication with an API key

Before using the library, you must initialize it with your HubSpot API key. If you're using Rails, put this code in an initializer:

```ruby
Hubspot.configure(hapikey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

If you have a HubSpot account, you can get your api key by logging in and visiting this url: https://app.hubspot.com/keys/get

## Authentication with OAuth 2.0

Configure the library with the client ID and secret from your [HubSpot App](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-an-app-in-hubspot)

```ruby
Hubspot.configure(
    client_id: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    client_secret: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    redirect_uri: "https://myapp.com/oauth")
```

To initiate an OAuth connection to your app, create a URL with the required scopes:

```ruby
Hubspot::OAuth.authorize_url(["contacts", "content"])
```

After the user accepts the scopes and installs the integration with their HubSpot account, they will be redirected to the URI requested with the query parameter `code` appended to the URL. `code` can then be passed to HubSpot to generate an access token:

```ruby
Hubspot::OAuth.create(params[:code])
```

To use the returned `access_token` string for authentication, you'll need to update the configuration:

```ruby
Hubspot.configure(
    client_id: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    client_secret: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    redirect_uri: "https://myapp.com/oauth",
    access_token: access_token)
```

Now all requests will use the provided access token when querying the API:

```ruby
Hubspot::Contact.all
```

### Refreshing the token

When you create a HubSpot OAuth token, it will have an expiration date given by the `expires_in` field returned from the create API. If you with to continue using the token without needing to create another, you'll need to refresh the token:

```ruby
Hubspot::OAuth.refresh(refresh_token)
```

### A note on OAuth credentials

At this time, OAuth tokens are configured globally rather than on a per-connection basis.

## Usage

Here's what you can do for now:

### Create a contact

```ruby
Hubspot::Contact.create!("email@address.com", {firstname: "First", lastname: "Last"})
```

#### In batches

```ruby
Hubspot::Contact.create_or_update!([{email: 'smith@example.com', firstname: 'First', lastname: 'Last'}])
```

### Find a contact

These methods will return a `Hubspot::Contact` object if successful, `nil` otherwise:

```ruby
Hubspot::Contact.find_by_email("email@address.com")
Hubspot::Contact.find_by_id(12345) # Pass the contact VID
```

### Update a contact

Given an instance of `Hubspot::Contact`, update its attributes with:

```ruby
contact.update!({firstname: "First", lastname: "Last"})
```

#### In batches

```ruby
Hubspot::Contact.create_or_update!([{vid: '12345', firstname: 'First', lastname: 'Last'}])
```

### Create a deal

```ruby
Hubspot::Deal.create!(nil, [company.vid], [contact.vid], pipeline: 'default', dealstage: 'initial_contact')
```

## Contributing to hubspot-ruby

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

### Testing

All tests can be run with `rake spec`. Isolate fast-running tests with `rake spec:quick`.

GET requests are pretty easy to test with VCR, but for POST/PUT requests, you probably want to update verify the state
of a live HubSpot instance. To do this, please add "live" tests to `spec/live/`, using the rspec label `live: true` in
order to disable VCR.

"Live" tests can be isolated with `rake spec:live`.
